# CreditCardApprovalPrediction
This project aims to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, similar to the systems used by commercial banks. The model will analyze applications and predict whether they should be approved or rejected based on factors like loan balances, income levels, and credit inquiries.
